# üì¶ combine-monitor

This is a personalized monitoring metrics processing project based on **Prometheus + Telegraf + InfluxDB**.  
The project uses **Telegraf to scrape metrics from Prometheus**, performs **custom processing and optimization**, and writes the results into **InfluxDB** for further querying.

The entire system is packaged as a **Kubernetes Pod service**, exposing a unified API interface.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: You must pre-deploy and configure **Prometheus**, **InfluxDB**, and **Telegraf** properly.

---

## üß© Architecture & Workflow

1. **Telegraf** scrapes metrics from Prometheus;
2. Inside Telegraf, custom plugins handle field filtering, renaming, and mapping;
3. Processed data is written into **InfluxDB**;
4. This project provides a **unified API** via a Pod to expose query capabilities;
5. The main logic is served under the `/queryservice` route, using configurations under the `config` directory to build InfluxDB queries;
6. Refer to `telegraf.conf` for detailed metric collection and filtering rules.

## üåê Example Request & Response

After deployment, you can query data using:

```bash
curl "http://192.168.3.76:30077/queryservice?metric=node_memory_MemFree_bytes&duration=1m"
